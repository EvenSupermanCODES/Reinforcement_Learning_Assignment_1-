## Overview
This repository hosts our work on the k-armed bandit problem, exploring various reinforcement learning strategies. The assignment's objective was to assess these strategies' effectiveness in maximizing rewards and identifying optimal actions.

## Algorithms Implemented
We have implemented and analyzed the following algorithms:
- Greedy approach with non-optimistic initial values
- Greedy approach with optimistic initial values
- Epsilon-Greedy approach
- Gradient Bandit algorithm

## Parameter Tuning
We conducted parameter tuning for the following elements:
- **Greedy Strategies**: Tested various starting values.
- **Epsilon-Greedy**: Experimented with different epsilon values.
- **Gradient Bandit**: Adjusted the learning rate (alpha).

## Results
Our findings are detailed in the Jupyter Notebooks, with plots illustrating each algorithm's performance under different scenarios.

## Setup and Reproduction Guide
Follow these instructions to set up your environment and reproduce our results:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone [repository-link]

2. Install the required libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib


### Execution
1. Navigate to the repository's directory:
cd [repository-name]

2. Start Jupyter lab:

3. Open the `.ipynb` files and execute the cells to see the code and results.

### Results Analysis
